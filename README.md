# Routed
Created as my Insight Data Science project in Jan-Feb 2019.

See an implementation for this project at http://getrouted.site 

Pls note: I didn't upload a word embedding dictionary required for item matching - if you are inclined to do so, you can build your own using the 50-dimension Common Web Crawl located at http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip

Also: you'll have to supply your own API key for steps in processing (geocoding + output display).
